## Learnings from Trendyol E-commerce Analysis Project

This project has provided several valuable insights and learnings throughout the process of analyzing the dataset and answering key business questions. Below are the key takeaways:

**1. Importance of Business Context**  
Understanding the business context before diving into SQL queries is crucial. By identifying and framing the business questions, the analysis could focus on actionable insights rather than generic data exploration.

**2. Effective Database Design**  
Creating and understanding the Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram was essential for understanding how different tables are related. This step saved significant time during the query-writing phase by providing clarity on joins and relationships between tables.

**3. Structured Approach to SQL Queries**  
A structured approach to writing SQL queries ensured clean, efficient, and error-free analysis. Breaking down complex queries into smaller steps made it easier to debug and understand.

**4. Optimization Techniques**  
Optimizing SQL queries by selecting only the required columns, indexing tables, and avoiding unnecessary joins improved the performance of the queries significantly, especially when dealing with large datasets.

**5. Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
Cleaning and preparing the dataset was a critical step. Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting ensured that the results were accurate and reliable.

**6. Insights-Driven Analysis**  
Focusing on deriving actionable insights rather than just descriptive statistics added value to the project. Each SQL query was tied back to a specific business question or decision-making need.

**7. Importance of Documentation**  
Documenting each step, from writing queries to explaining results, ensured the project was reproducible and understandable for others.

**8. Challenges and Problem-Solving**  
Several challenges were encountered, such as optimizing queries for large tables and handling ambiguous data points. Addressing these challenges provided a deeper understanding of advanced SQL techniques and problem-solving strategies.

**9. Continuous Learning**  
Throughout the project, new SQL functions and concepts were learned, such as window functions, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), and subqueries. This broadened the skill set and opened up possibilities for more complex analyses in the future.

**10. Collaboration and Feedback**  
Feedback from peers and mentors helped refine the queries and improve the overall quality of the project. Collaboration emphasized the importance of clear communication and teamwork in data analysis projects.

**Conclusion**  
This project not only improved technical SQL skills but also emphasized the importance of a structured, business-focused, and insight-driven approach to data analysis. The lessons learned here will serve as a foundation for future projects.
